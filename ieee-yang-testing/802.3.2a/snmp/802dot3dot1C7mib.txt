               Figure 9-2 for a 10 Mb/s repeater, and to the START 
               state of see IEEE Std 802.3, Figure 27-2 for a

               Setting this object to noReset(1) has no effect.
               The agent will return the value noReset(1)
               when this object is read.

               After receiving a request to set this variable to
               reset(2), the agent is allowed to delay the reset
               for a short period. For example, the implementor
               may choose to delay the reset long enough to allow
               the SNMP response to be transmitted. In any
               event, SNMP requires that a response be transmitted.

               action is the execution of a disruptive Self-Test
               with the following characteristics:  a) The nature
               of the tests is not specified. b) The test resets
               the repeater but without affecting management
               information about the repeater. c) The test does
               not inject packets onto any segment. d) Packets
               received during the test may or may not be
               transferred. e) The test does not interfere with
               management functions.

               After performing this self-test, the agent will
               update the repeater health information (including
               rptrInfoOperStatus), and send a rptrInfoResetEvent
               notification."

               An event whose length is greater than 74 bit times
               but less than 82 bit times shall increment either
               the shortEvents counter or the runts counter but
               not both. A CarrierEvent greater than or equal to
               552 bit times but less than 565 bit times may or
               may not be counted as a runt.

               ValidPacketMinTime has tolerances included to
               provide for circuit losses between a conformance
               test point at the AUI and the measurement point
               within the state machine.

               Runts usually indicate collision fragments, a
               normal network event. In certain situations
               associated with large diameter networks a
               percentage of collision fragments may exceed
               ValidPacketMinTime.

               The approximate minimum time for rollover of this
               counter is 16 hours in a 10 Mb/s repeater."

       DESCRIPTION
               "This table contains one entry per repeater in the
               repeater system. It defines objects that allow a network
               management application to instruct an agent to watch
               for a given MAC address and report which port it
               was seen on. Only one address search can be in
               progress on each repeater at any one time. Before
               starting an address search, a management application
               should obtain 'ownership' of the entry in
               rptrAddrSearchTable for the repeater that is to
               perform the search. This is accomplished with the
               rptrAddrSearchLock and rptrAddrSearchStatus as
               follows:

                         == FAILURE)
                       /* Another manager got the lock */
                       goto try_again

                   /* I have the lock */
                   set (rptrAddrSearchAddress = <search target>)

                   wait for rptrAddrSearchState to change from none

                   if (rptrAddrSearchState == single)
                       get (rptrAddrSearchGroup, rptrAddrSearchPort)
                   /* release the lock, making sure not to overwrite
                      anyone else's lock */
                   set (rptrAddrSearchLock = lock_value+1,
                        rptrAddrSearchStatus = notInUse,
                        rptrAddrSearchOwner = '')

               A management station first retrieves the values of
               the appropriate instances of the rptrAddrSearchLock
               and rptrAddrSearchStatus objects, periodically
               repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value
               of rptrAddrSearchStatus is 'notInUse'. The
               management station then tries to set the same
               instance of the rptrAddrSearchLock object to the
               value it just retrieved, the same instance of the
               rptrAddrSearchStatus object to 'inUse', and the
               corresponding instance of rptrAddrSearchOwner to a
               value indicating itself. If the set operation
               succeeds, then the management station has obtained
               ownership of the rptrAddrSearchEntry, and the value
               of rptrAddrSearchLock is incremented by the agent (as
               per the semantics of TestAndIncr). Failure of the
               set operation indicates that some other manager has
               obtained ownership of the rptrAddrSearchEntry.

               Once ownership is obtained, the management station
               can proceed with the search operation. Note that the
               agent will reset rptrAddrSearchStatus to 'notInUse'
               if it has been in the 'inUse' state for an abnormally
               long period of time, to prevent a misbehaving manager
               from permanently locking the entry. It is suggested
               that this timeout period be between one and five
               minutes.

               When the management station has completed its search
               operation, it should free the entry by setting
               the instance of the rptrAddrSearchLock object to the
               previous value + 1, the instance of the
               rptrAddrSearchStatus to 'notInUse', and the instance
               of rptrAddrSearchOwner to a zero length string. This
               is done to prevent overwriting another station's
               lock."
